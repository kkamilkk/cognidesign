      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a motivated Junior Frontend Developer actively seeking remote opportunities. Recently completing a
        Front-end bootcamp at the Software Development Academy, I bring a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. With a background in IT support and website development, I am eager to contribute to dynamic
        projects within a collaborative environment.
